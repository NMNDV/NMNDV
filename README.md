- 👋 Hi, I’m @NMNDV
- A nerd python developer, ML/data enthusiast, a business analyst, and a digital marketer.
- I won the MSTC-WOC 2020 competition in data analytics and all my projects are available at Kaggle- kaggle.com/namandave/notebooks.
- I was also a mentor in Django for girls - DSC, Gandhinagar.
- I also know C/C++, Java, R, JavaScript languages, and DBMS, Computer Networks concepts and frameworks/APIs/Tools of ML as well as Data visualization and development. 
- I know data structures and algorithms too.
- My functionality crosses over between analyst, machine learning/deep learning engineer, software developer.
- I know about implementing ML/AI in applications especially when applications require Image Processing or NLP.
-
- 👀 I’m interested in develoing solution to the problems that are arbitrary 
- i.e. the problems that may occur in any field and are solvable through any skills. 
- During my studies I've worked on almost all the aspects of the programming and development 
- and therefore I am interested in building solutions to the problems created by the challenges faced by the shifting demands.
-
- 🌱 I’m currently a student of CSE, and have done two speciallizations (1) Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science, 
- and 2) AI From The Data Center To The Edge – An Optimized Path Using Intel® Architecture) as well as an AI/ML product development internship. 
- An internship in which I built/developed applications and programs that included the AI-ML, primarily in the medical field. 
- Learned how the computer vision and NLP are used in real world applications and in the area of medical tools and software (Android/Web/Cloud).
-
- 💻 Skills: 
- C/C++,  Python,  Java,  JS  
- Progamming language is a bridge between your thoughs and the computer, not a barrier
- Machine Learning - Artificial Intelligence,  DBMS
