- 👋 Hi, I’m @NMNDV<br />
A nerd python developer, ML/data enthusiast, a business analyst, and a digital marketer.<br />
I won the MSTC-WOC 2020 competition in data analytics and all my projects are available at Kaggle- kaggle.com/namandave/notebooks.<br />
I was also a mentor in Django for girls - DSC, Gandhinagar.<br />
I also know C/C++, Java, R, JavaScript languages, and DBMS, Computer Networks concepts and frameworks/APIs/Tools of ML as well as Data visualization and development. <br />
I know data structures and algorithms too.<br />
My functionality crosses over between analyst, machine learning/deep learning engineer, software developer.<br />
I know about implementing ML/AI in applications especially when applications require Image Processing or NLP.<br /><br />

- 👀 I’m interested in develoing solution to the problems that are arbitrary <br />
i.e. the problems that may occur in any field and are solvable through any skills. <br />
During my studies I've worked on almost all the aspects of the programming and development <br />
and therefore I am interested in building solutions to the problems created by the challenges faced by the shifting demands.<br /><br />

- 🌱 I’m currently a student of CSE, and have done two speciallizations (1) Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python & R In Data Science, <br />
and 2) AI From The Data Center To The Edge – An Optimized Path Using Intel® Architecture) as well as an AI/ML product development internship. <br />
An internship in which I built/developed applications and programs that included the AI-ML, primarily in the medical field. <br />
Learned how the computer vision and NLP are used in real world applications and in the area of medical tools and software (Android/Web/Cloud).<br /><br />

- 💻 Skills: <br />
C/C++,  Python,  Java,  JS  <br />
Progamming language is a bridge between your thoughs and the computer, not a barrier<br />
Machine Learning - Artificial Intelligence,  DBMS<br />
Product Development / Management,  AdSense<br />
Image Processing,  Data Analytics,  Data Mining, Web-scrapping<br /><br />

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects/problems related to the above mentioned areas.<br /><br />
